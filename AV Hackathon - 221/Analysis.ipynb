    "## Preprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We have null values in Health indicator, Holding policy duration and Holding Policy type.\n",
    "2. Is Null data representing any information? --> `YES` \n",
    "\n",
    "**Null in Health Indicator**\n",
    "\n",
    " - It means data is unavailable. Now in what cases data can be unavailable?\n",
    " - Data collection team deleted that data due to security reasons.\n",
    " - Customer didn't bring the medical report.\n",
    " - Providing medical report is not mandatory.\n",
    " - Company was not collecting (not made mandatory) at the time of subscription.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Holding policy duration / type**\n",
    " - They are the new customers for the company as they have never took any policy before. \n",
    " - We will represent them with a new value.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Since the dataset is unbalanced so we will use either oversampling or undersampling.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Baseline Model (VERSION 1)\n",
    " - Fill NA with -999 \n",
    " - One Hot Encode all categorical data\n",
    " - Performed oversampling with SMOTE and got AUC = 0.85 for random forest.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Feature engineering (VERSION 2)\n",
    "\n",
    " - `14+` in Holding_Policy_Duration will be represented by `15`\n",
    " - Remove Region_code for now\n",
    " - Encode accomodation type as- \n",
    "   - 0 --> Rented\n",
    "   - 1 --> Owned\n",
    " - Encode insurance type as- \n",
    "   - 0 --> Individual\n",
    "   - 1 --> Joint\n",
    " - Encode is_spouse type as- \n",
    "   - 0 --> No\n",
    "   - 1 --> Yes\n",
    " - Fill NA in Health indicator with X0 and one hot encode it.\n",
    " - One hot encode city_code and drop city_code\n",
    " - Split the data.(**BREAKPOINT 1**)\n",
    " - Use standard scaler for reco_policy_premium as its almost normally distributed.\n",
    " - Use MinMax scaler for upper_Age and lower_age as they don't have outlier but we need to scale it in between 0 and 1.\n",
    " - Oversample the train set.\n",
    " - With XGB classifier we get AUC of 0.83\n",
    "\n",
    " ## Trying to improve model (VERSION 3)\n",
    " - Clone the dataframe upto **BREAKPOINT 1** to a new variable.\n",
    " - Use log tranformation for all upper_age, lower_age and reco_policy_premium.\n",
    " - Build the model with oversampling.\n",
    " - we will get AUC = 0.83 but on the public score board the score improved to 61%\n",
    "\n",
    " # In VERSION 12 doing some more feature engineering\n",
    "  - Encode city based on bussiness value -\n",
    "  <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "<code>city_value = {\n",
    "    '1':['C29', 'C35', 'C34', 'C32', 'C20', 'C4'],\n",
    "    '2':['C23', 'C25', 'C33', 'C16','C6', 'C13'], \n",

    "}</code>\n",
    " - Remaining will be same as **VERSION 2** upto **BREAKPOINT 1**\n",
    " - create a variable to represent city and accomodation together say living_lux\n",
    " - create a variable that represent both type and premium of recomended policy.\n",
    " - and a meta variable, sum of all the data in the row except Response.\n",
    " - Build the model with oversampling.\n",
    " - **With XGB classifier we will get AUC = 0.88, 3% increase from baseline model.**"
